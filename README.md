System is still work in progress but pretty stable now.
Only Character sheet is available. All items have a sheet.
Lots of things are autocalculated. Modifiers can be found in the character 'info' tab. Report an issue or message me on discord to add something I missed.

Not Implemented but planned:
* Vehicles/Drones
* Sprites & Sprites
* Hosts
* Targetted Rolls
* Better Inititiative Tracking

Work in progress.
