# A FoundryVTT System Module for Shadowrun 6th World

This system module implements Shadowrun 6th Worldâ€‹ (edition) for FoundryVTT. 

## Status!

I'm actively developing this for the game I'm in. It is technically a fork of the 5th edition repository, but code-wise, I've started from the ground up. 

Currently the only implemented thing is part of the full character sheet, but stay tuned to the master branch.

## Rules Drift

The game I'm doing this for makes changes to the 6th edition rules-as-written and these changes will eventually be included in this module on a special branch. My intent is for the `master` branch to work for the unmodified rules.
